tmsu-helpers
============

leveraging http://www.tmsu.org/:

* gtmsu is a very basic graphical tmsu frontend to easily tag files (e.g. from programs such as gqview)
  this works, but is cumbersome because most UI's don't give proper feedback.
  That's why I started the [pixie](https://github.com/Dieterbe/pixie) project, which is (for the photo use case) a much better solution.
* it also used to contain a script to generate albums in a cheap reproducable way by basically configuring
  a match expression (tags to match and not match) per album, but that's now moved into the [pixie](https://github.com/Dieterbe/pixie) repo.
